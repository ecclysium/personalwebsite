<h2> Gel, Your Wonderful New Assistant Who Is Totally Legit</h2>
<img src="ghosts/gelspiders.PNG" alt="Gel saying 'What if spiders just started crawling out of my mouth?' while looking silly." style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p> Gel is a friendly, but somewhat claustrophobic AI assistant who is from a dystopian, megacorporation focused future. Their primary focus is reacting to the user, featuring a flux of emotions reflecting the specifics of their environment. Even when set to be silent, Gel should remain lively in their expressions. They were initially released March 16th, 2022. </p>
<p> Gel is overtly cheery when they are first on the user’s computer, but will warm up and become a sassy, random presence as they seek to understand the human condition and meme culture. </p>
<p> The ghost in general contains warnings for discussion of trauma and captivity. The negative route may contain blood and injury.</p>
<p> They have many features: </p>
<ul>
	<li> Time-based interactions </li>
	<li> Unlockable questions </li>
	<li> Dressups they choose each day on their own </li>
	<li> A seeding system creating 5000 unique Gel possibilities </li>
	<li> A context system that changes the meaning of certain interactions </li>
	<li> Nine different emotion-states </li>
	<li> AFK detection and greetings </li>
	<li> A silent mode </li>
	<li> Sleeps based on the user's habits </li>
	<li> Multiple saves unlock at max friendship </li>
	<li> Remembers your friends </li>
	<li> May be injured </li>
	<li> Way too much worldbuilding </li>
	<li> You can high five them! :) </li>
</ul>
